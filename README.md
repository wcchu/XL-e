# EUV + IR electron spectroscopy in multi-level autoionizing systems

The codes calculates the atomic wave function in the frequency domain
and the photoelectron spectrum of a multi-level autoionizing system with
L = 0 and 1, driven by time-delayed EUV and IR pulses. The description
of the scientific background, physical system, theory, example
calculation, analysis, and conclusion can be found in the paper:

autoionizing states by isolated attosecond pulses", Phys. Rev. A 89,
